# I'm in love 💘 (no bitches allowed)

## Just trying to code... 💻  
Just here to learn, build, and experiment with tech. No fancy stuff, just coding. 👨‍💻

## What I'm doing rn? 📀
- Switching from Windows to Linux
  - ~~(*I use Debian btw*)~~
  - (*I use Arch btw*)
  
#### A super-duper *_BAD_* joke:

1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode?  
2. Because the light attracts bugs. 🐛

I hope that made u laugh! (at least just a smile)


## Contact 💬  
I eagerly await your message about coding and teaching me stuff! 😊

Feel free to contact me via *_DISCORD_*: `ciocco`
